Ten-Reputation

Ten-Reputation is a Web3-powered, AI-driven property management platform developed for the Somnia AI Hackathon 2025. It enables landlords to manage tenants, rent, utilities, and taxes with automation and transparency, while tenants build on-chain reputation scores without directly interacting with blockchain systems.

Overview

The system brings trust and efficiency to rental management by combining artificial intelligence, blockchain, and real-world payment integrations. It allows landlords to handle buildings and tenants in one place, automatically verify rent and utility payments, and generate reputation NFTs for tenants. The AI agent verifies payment and meter data, stores records securely, and updates tenant reputation scores transparently on the Somnia network.

Problem

Landlords often track rent and utilities manually using spreadsheets or chat apps, leading to disputes and data loss. Tenants have no reliable way to prove their payment history or credibility. Financial summaries and tax calculations are also tedious and error-prone.

Solution

Ten-Reputation provides an AI-enhanced system that automates these processes. Landlords can register buildings, tenants, and utility meters. Payments through familiar methods such as M-Pesa, Co-op Bank, PayPal, or Stripe are verified by an AI agent. The agent checks timeliness and accuracy, reads meter images, and updates tenant payment records. Tenant reliability is represented by non-transferable NFTs stored on the Somnia blockchain. Landlords can view these reputation scores when evaluating new tenants.

Features

Tenants view rent and utility balances, payment due dates, and pay through normal channels.
Landlords manage buildings, units, tenants, and utility meters from a single dashboard.
AI agents read meter images, verify payments, detect anomalies, and generate financial summaries.
Somnia DB stores meter images, payment proofs, and tax-related documents. Hashes of stored data are linked on-chain for verification.
Tenant reputation NFTs automatically update after every verified payment.
Landlords can view tenant payment status, arrears, and generate tax and income reports.

AI Agent Functions

Meter recognition and authenticity checks.
Payment verification through connected APIs.
Smart contract interaction for NFT updates.
Automated reporting and analytics generation.

Blockchain Layer

The smart contract on Somnia Testnet manages NFT minting, reputation updates, and event logging.
Tenants are abstracted from blockchain complexity; all interactions are handled through backend automation.
Reputation NFTs are soulbound and publicly visible to other landlords through the Somnia explorer.

Frontend

Developed using Scaffold-ETH and React.
Tenant interface provides rent details and payment status.
Landlord interface provides management tools, dashboards, and financial analytics.
The design keeps blockchain details invisible to users while ensuring transparent, verifiable data in the background.

Backend and AI Infrastructure

Payment integration through Node.js and AWS Lambda.
AI image recognition using TensorFlow.js or AWS Rekognition.
Data storage and AI processing with Somnia DB.
Notifications via AWS SNS or Twilio.
Blockchain interaction handled through Ethers.js and the Somnia SDK.

Demonstration Flow

The landlord logs in, registers a property, and adds tenants and meters.
The AI agent verifies meter image authenticity and listens for payment events.
When a payment is confirmed, the AI agent updates the smart contract, logs the transaction, and adjusts the tenantâ€™s NFT reputation score.
The landlord views tenant payment status, arrears, and monthly summaries.
The updated reputation NFT is visible on the Somnia network for transparency.

Hackathon Relevance

Ten-Reputation demonstrates how AI agents can operate autonomously to verify off-chain actions and interact with blockchain contracts. It aligns with the Somnia hackathon goals of combining AI, automation, and decentralized systems in a practical real-world use case.
